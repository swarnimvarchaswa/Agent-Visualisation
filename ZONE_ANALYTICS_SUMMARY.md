# Agent Analytics Dashboard - Summary

## 🎉 What We've Built

I've created a comprehensive analytics dashboard with multiple tools for analyzing agent data. Here's what's ready:

### 1. **Home Page** (/)
- Modern, professional landing page
- Cards showing both available tools
- Quick stats showing:
  - 862 Total Agents
  - 549 Active Users (have made enquiries)
  - 253 October Active
  - 57 This Week Active
- Easy navigation to both tools

### 2. **Agent Visualizer** (/agent-visualizer)
- Your existing interactive network graph
- Now includes a "Home" button to navigate back
- Visualizes connections between agents, enquiries, and properties

### 3. **Zone Analytics** (/zone-analytics) - NEW! ✨
- Displays all 862 agents with their zone distribution
- Each agent shows:
  - Agent ID and Name
  - FSM Token status (green badge if they have it)
  - Total enquiries and properties count
  - **Zone distribution bar** showing percentage across:
    - 🔵 North Bangalore (Blue)
    - 🟢 South Bangalore (Green)
    - 🟠 East Bangalore (Amber)
    - 🔴 West Bangalore (Red)
    - 🟣 Central Bangalore (Purple)
    - ⚪ Other (Gray)

#### Zone Analytics Features:
- **Search**: Filter by agent name or ID
- **FSM Token Filter**: Show only agents with FSM tokens
- **Sorting Options**:
  - Sort by Enquiries (default)
  - Sort by Inventories
  - Sort by Name
- **Visual Zone Bars**: Each agent has a colorful horizontal bar showing their zone distribution
- **Zone Details**: Hover tooltips and detailed counts below each bar

## 🔍 How It Works

The Zone Analytics page:
1. Reads all agents from `agents.json`
2. For each agent, gets their `enquiryDid` and `myInventories` arrays
3. Looks up each enquiry in `enquiries.json` to get the property ID
4. Looks up each property in `properties.json` to get the zone
5. Calculates the percentage distribution across all zones
6. Displays a visual bar showing the zone breakdown

## 🎨 Color Scheme

Each zone has a distinct color for easy identification:
- North: Blue (#3b82f6)
- South: Green (#10b981)
- East: Amber (#f59e0b)
- West: Red (#ef4444)
- Central: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Other: Gray (#6b7280)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Choose which tool you want to use
3. In Zone Analytics:
   - Use filters to narrow down agents
   - Click on FSM Token checkbox to see only agents who can receive notifications
   - Search for specific agents
   - Sort by different metrics

## 📊 Data Insights Available

From the zone analytics, you can now:
- See which agents focus on which zones
- Identify agents with FSM tokens in specific zones
